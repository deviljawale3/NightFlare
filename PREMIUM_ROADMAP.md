# 🌌 NightFlare Phase 3: "Ascension" Roadmap
## Target: AAA Premium Quality on Play Store

We have solidified the foundation (Loading, Haptics, Audio, Rewards). Phase 3 focuses on **Visual Mastery** and **Gameplay Depth** to create that "wow" factor that distinguishes top-tier games.

---

## 🎨 **1. Visual Fidelity Upgrade (The "AAA" Look)**
*Goal: Make the game look expensive and immersive.*

*   **Post-Processing Pipeline**:
    *   **Bloom**: Essential for the "NightFlare" neon aesthetic. Light sources (player core, projectiles, enemies) should glow.
    *   **Tone Mapping**: ACES Filmic Tone Mapping for cinematic contrast.
    *   **Vignette & Chromatic Aberration**: Subtle lens effects for damage/impact feedback.
*   **Particle System 2.0**:
    *   Replace basic shapes with rich particle effects for:
        *   Enemy deaths (dissolve/shatter).
        *   Projectile trails.
        *   Resource collection (sucking essence sounds/visuals).

## 🌠 **2. 3D Constellation Mastery**
*Goal: Make progression feel epic.*

*   **Interactive Sky Map**: 
    *   Replace the 2D SVG overlay with a fully 3D `Canvas` layer where the player rotates a celestial sphere to find star nodes.
    *   Connecting nodes draws 3D beams of light.
    *   Unlocking a "Major Star" triggers a cosmic visual event.

## 🤖 **3. Drone Companion 2.0**
*Goal: Add a "pet" mechanic that players love.*

*   **Visual Overhaul**: Replace simple spheres with a mechanical "Cyber-Wisp" design (animated wings/thrusters).
*   **Behavior Upgrade**:
    *   **Guardian Mode**: Shoots small lasers at nearby enemies.
    *   **Harvester Mode**: (Existing) flies to resources.
    *   **Medic Mode**: Heals player slowly when out of combat.
*   **Customization**: Allow players to color/skin their drone.

## 🛍️ **4. The "Nexus" Shop**
*Goal: Premium monetization feel (even if using soft currency).*

*   **3D Showroom**:
    *   A dedicated scene to view Player Skins and Weapon Models.
    *   "Try On" feature where the character performs an attack animation with the selected item.
*   **Content**:
    *   **Skins**: "Cyber-Ninja", "Void Walker", "Solar Knight".
    *   **Drone Shells**: "Rusty Pod", "High-Tech Orb".

## ⚔️ **5. Combat Juice**
*Goal: Make hitting things feel satisfying.*

*   **Hit Stop**: Freeze frame on heavy impacts (already partially there, refine it).
*   **Camera Trauma**: Directional screen shake (shake *away* from the hit).
*   **Floating Text 2.0**: 3D damage numbers that pop and physics-bounce.
