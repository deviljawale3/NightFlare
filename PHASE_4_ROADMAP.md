# NightFlare Phase 4: "Hybrid Horizons" Roadmap

By combining the strongest elements of Social, Content, and RPG systems, we aim to create a game that is deep, endless, and connected.

## 1. The "Titan" Update (Content + Visuals)
*Focus: Bosses and Big Weapons.*
- **Feature: Orbital Strike System**: Implement the visual and gameplay logic for the Orbital Strike button.
  - **Visuals**: A massive pillar of ion energy from the sky.
  - **Gameplay**: Vaporizes all non-boss enemies in a wide radius and deals massive damage to bosses.
- **Feature: The "Colossus" Boss**: A multi-tile, massive enemy that requires breaking armor points before damage can be dealt.
- **New Weapon**: **"Chain Lightning Staff"** - Arcs between enemies, perfect for crowd control.

## 2. The "Echo" System (Social)
*Focus: Competitive Connectivity.*
- **Feature: Ghost Rivals**: Record player runs. When playing, download a "Ghost" of a friend or leaderboard rival to race against in real-time.
- **Feature: Base Showdown**: Allow players to "Test" a friend's base defense layout with their own character.

## 3. The "Artificer" System (RPG Depth)
*Focus: Customization and Grinding.*
- **Feature: Modular Weapon Crafting**:
  - Instead of just "Sword", craft "Sword + Fire Core + Heavy Hilt".
  - visual updates for weapons based on components.
- **Feature: Drone Engineering**:
  - Customize drone behaviors chips (e.g., "Aggressive" vs "Defensive" AI).

## Immediate Action Plan (Sprint 1)
1.  **Implement Orbital Strike VFX**: Make the button actually call down thunder.
2.  **Add Chain Lightning Weapon**: New attack type for the player.
3.  **Deploy "Colossus" Prototype**: Basic logic for a large-scale boss.

**Shall we begin with the Orbital Strike functionality?**
